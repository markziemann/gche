### Introduction
I will begin my description of how I plan, teach and support learning by mentioning briefly the theories of
learning that guide me, most of which I became formally aquanted with during my study of EEE730 - 
Contextualising Learning and Teaching in Higher Education. My teaching is mostly influenced by Constructivism,
Social Learning Theory, Feminism and Humanism. The works of Professor Eric Mazur strongly resonate with me,
in particular his approaches to the flipped classrooms, skill development, measuring learning outcomes and
assessment ([Mazur 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92O6NlOGt1o)). The primary thesis of Mazur is that 
education is much more than the transfer of information, rather, meaningful skills are developed with 
communication, practise and trial and error. It is with practise and self-knowledge that learners reflect on
the importance of learning as a lifelong journey. In this paper I will be describing the process that I
undertake to deliver a unit from planning through to feedback and assessment. 

### Planning

Planning is the most important aspect of delivering a unit. For a unit to be successful, the goals of the 
unit need to be clearly defined and fit coherently within the graduate learning goals for the course. 
The learning outcomes need to be commensurate for the level of study, that is neither too simple nor too
complex. The learining outcomes need to be highly specific. The learning goals for the unit need to be 
aligned with the assessment tasks and the learning activities.
If these are not aligned, the learning experience of the students are diminished:

* Learning outcomes overlap between units. Redundancies like this can diminish student enthusiasm and waste
student and teacher efforts.

* Assessments that are not aligned to the learning outcomes can cause students to become cynical. Students
begin to think that the assessments are simply boxes to tick , hurdles to summount, busy-work. Students see
the unit as disjointed and a waste of time.

* When the learning activities do not align with what is assessed, students will either not engage with these
activities or when they do engage, feel they have not been properly rewarded for doing so. 

In summary, formulating unit learning outcomes (ULOs) is critical. When doing this, I always remind myself 
as to what are the graduate learning outcomes are for the course. I see that as the end goal. Then I review the 
learning outcomes for the other units that students will complete in their course. Based on this information I
can focus on the specific skills that need to be emphasized in the unit I am planning. In addition, I always
seek advice from course coordinators, who generally have a good overview of the areas that need attention in a 
course. The ULOs need to be specific. Saying students should "understand concept X" is unsatisfactory because
understanding can be superficial or deep. I refer to the verbs in Bloom's taxonomy (Figure 1) and select the
highest level that is realistic for most students to attain. 

![BloomsTax](blooms.png)
Figure 1. Verbs from Bloom's taxonomy are useful in formulating well defined ULOs. Graphic source: Fractal Learning 2017).

Four or five specific and well crafted ULOs that span different levels of the taxonomy is appropriate. This is 
in contrast to conventional units where there could be up to 10 different topics taught. A skilled unit designer
will be able to identify and emphasize the core and threshold concepts that interweave the different topics 
together. They will focus on what students are required to _do_ with the knowledge and skills they have 
attained. In the end it is what the student _does_ which is more important than what the student _is_ or the 
teaching styles used (Biggs and Tang 2011, p20).

The specific verbs used in the design of ULOs are particularly helpful in designing assessment tasks. It also 
reinforces to teachers to design assessment tasks that reach higher in the taxonomy.

It is also important that the students have sufficient time to develop deep thinking on any topic. There is 
a trade-off that lecturers must come to terms with. Students have a finite bandwidth; by "covering" a different 
topic in each of the 11 teaching weeks, we guarantee that students will develop only a very superficial
understanding of each. Certainly, in my own experience, the prime time for teaching new concepts is the first
six or seven weeks of trimester. As students get closer to the end of trimester, they are more focused on 
juggling the many assessment deadlines and exams they need to complete that they are no longer in the mindset
to receive new information.

Students need space and time to assimilate this information, and motivation to focus on
particular learning activities, which comes partly from intrinsic motivation but also the need to attain a 
satisfactory grade. As stated earlier, practice is the most important contributor to student engangement and
learning, so there should be no topics presented that are not practiced with assessment. 

On the other hand if we focus on only one or topics in depth then students may miss out on some information.
There is somewhere between these extremes a good balance. This optimal balance should focus on the more 
fundamental concepts which intertwine between the minor topic. 

Inertia in unit plans.

Not making too much work for the teacher in terms of marking.

Mentoring and feedback from teaching mentors

Taking upon feedback from students (not only the high engagement students but all)

### Teaching
The overwhelmingly the most important aspect to quality teaching is _what the students do_,
not their innate capability, nor the manner in which the information is given to the students.

With the wonders of technology, the transmission of information part can be conducted with online learning
materials including videos, lecturer's notes and readings.

Put the information transfer online. It is the component that is less important than the assimilation of
this knowledge (but higher educators seem to invest most significantly into this aspect).

So what do we do in lectures and tutorials

Mazur (2013) suggest the following recipe (Figure 2). In the lecture the teacher poses questions and 
explain the details in the question, then give the students a few minutes to consider their answer in
silent individual contemplation. The next step is to poll the students, the 

Poll the students individually. (Do not show the poll results yet)

Get them to convince another student who had a different answer for several minutes.

Poll again. Show the class the re-polling results.

Explain the basis of the answer. If the class is divided, then get different student perspectives.

```{r,teachingflowchart,echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 2. A recipe for social learning."}
library(DiagrammeR)
grViz("digraph flowchart {
      # node definitions with substituted label text
      node [fontname = Helvetica, shape = rectangle]        
      tab1 [label = '@@1']
      tab2 [label = '@@2']
      tab3 [label = '@@3']
      tab4 [label = '@@4']
      tab5 [label = '@@5']
      tab6 [label = '@@6']
      
      # edge definitions with the node IDs
      tab1 -> tab2 -> tab3 -> tab4 -> tab5 -> tab6 -> tab1 ;
      }

      [1]: 'question'
      [2]: 'think'
      [3]: 'poll'
      [4]: 'discuss'
      [5]: 'repoll'
      [6]: 'explain'
      ")
```

The wonderful thing about this type of lecture format is that it is:

* Highly active. Students must engage their mind into the discussion.

* Teacher gets immediate feedback; informs teaching practices

* Students assess their own knowledge; get immediate feedback; students can reflect on their own performance

* Time efficient: classroom time is best used for interactive sessions. Peer instruction helps students get
formative feedback which is not dependent on the teaching staff marking assignments.
