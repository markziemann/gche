## Assessment Task 
### Brief Description of Assessment Task
The student will describe how they plan, teach and support learning that demonstrates active learning,
inclusivity and appropriate use of learning technologies.

### Details of Student Output
Description of planning, teaching and supporting learning that demonstrates active learning, inclusivity and
appropriate use of learning technologies.

### Grading and weighting (% total mark for unit)
40% ‐ Ungraded Pass.
Word Limit: 1500 words.

### Assessment of Unit Learning Outcomes, Graduate Learning Outcomes and UK
Professional Standards Framework Descriptors
By completing this task, you will be addressing ULO 1; GLOs 1, 3 and 8; and A1, A2, K1, K2, K3, V1, V2 and V4
from the UK Professional Standards Framework. In this respect, it is important to review the assessment
criteria and the marking rubric to ensure that you are addressing all the elements.

### Completing Assessment Task One
To complete Assessment Task 1 you will need to:

* Use the principles of constructive alignment to describe how you develop Intended Learning
Outcomes that are appropriate for the level of study and which clearly describe what the student will
know / be able to do by the completion of the unit of study (ULO 1, GLO 1, A1, K1 and K2).

* Identify Teaching and Learning Activities that activate learning in the Intended Learning Outcomes
and demonstrate contemporary, active and inclusive teaching practices in higher education (ULO 1,
GLO 1, GLO 8, A1, A2, K1, K2, K3, V1, V2, and V4).

* Describe how your pedagogical practices support student learning including making reference to your
beliefs about how students learn and what these beliefs entail for the approaches that you take in
your teaching (ULO 1, A2, K1, K2, K3, and V1).

* Provide evidence for how the Assessment Tasks are aligned to the appropriate ILOs and explain how
the Assessment Tasks are requiring students to engage with the action verbs in the ILOs (ULO 1, GLO
1, A1, K1 and K2).

* Explain the rationale for your use of learning technologies in your unit of study with reference to
Intended Learning Outcomes, Teaching and Learning Activities and Assessment Tasks (ULO 1, GLO 3,
A1, A2, K1, and K2).

### Assessment Task 1 Rubric
Whilst assessments in this unit will be marked in terms of 'demonstrated' or 'not demonstrated', the rubrics
present different gradations of demonstrated to guide you in completing the Assessment Tasks. The feedback
that you receive on your assessment will provide you with more information on the extent to which you have
demonstrated or not demonstrated achievement of the Intended Learning Outcomes the Professional
Standard Descriptors for this unit.

## My response
### Introduction
I will begin my description of how I plan, teach and support learning by mentioning briefly the theories of
learning that guide me, most of which I became formally aquanted with during my study of EEE730 - 
Contextualising Learning and Teaching in Higher Education. My teaching is mostly influenced by Constructivism,
Social Learning Theory, Feminism and Humanism. The works of Professor Eric Mazur strongly resonate with me,
in particular his approaches to the flipped classrooms, skill development, measuring learning outcomes and
assessment ([Mazur 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92O6NlOGt1o)). The primary thesis of Mazur is that 
education is much more than the transfer of information, rather, meaningful skills are developed with 
practise and trial and error. It is with practise and self-knowledge that learners reflect on
the importance of learning as a lifelong journey.

### Planning
Planning is the most important aspect of delivering a unit. For a unit to be successful, the goals of the 
unit need to be clearly defined and fit coherently within the graduate learning goals for the course. 
The learning goals for the unit need to be aligned with the assessment tasks and the learning activities.
If these are not aligned, the learning experience of the students are diminished:

* Learning outcomes overlap between units. Redundancies like this can diminish student enthusiasm and waste
student and teacher efforts.

* Assessments that are not aligned to the learning outcomes can cause students to become cynical. Students
begin to think that the assessments are simply boxes to tick , hurdles to summount, busy-work. Students see
the unit as disjointed and a waste of time.

* When the learning activities do not align with what is assessed, students will either not engage with these
activities or when they do engage, feel they have not been properly rewarded for doing so. 

It is also important that the students have sufficient time to develop deep thinking on any topic. There is 
a trade-off that lecturers must come to terms with. Students have a finite bandwidth; by "covering" a different 
topic in each of the 11 teaching weeks, we guarantee that students will develop only a very superficial
understanding of each. Certainly, in my own experience, the prime time for teaching new concepts is the first
six or seven weeks of trimester. As students get closer to the end of trimester, they are more focused on 
juggling the many assessment deadlines and exams they need to complete that they are no longer in the mindset
to receive new information.

Students need space and time to assimilate this information, and motivation to focus on
particular learning activities, which comes partly from intrinsic motivation but also the need to attain a 
satisfactory grade. As stated earlier, practice is the most important contributor to student engangement and
learning, so there should be no topics presented that are not practiced with assessment. 

On the other hand if we focus on only one or topics in depth then students may miss out on some information.
There is somewhere between these extremes a good balance. This optimal balance should focus on the more 
fundamental concepts which intertwine between the minor topic. 

Inertia in unit plans.

Not making too much work for the teacher in terms of marking.

Mentoring and feedback from teaching mentors

Taking upon feedback from students (not only the high engagement students but all)

### Teaching
The overwhelmingly the most important aspect to quality teaching is _what the students do_,
not their innate capability, nor the manner in which the information is given to the students.

With the wonders of technology, the transmission of information part can be conducted with online learning
materials including videos, lecturer's notes and readings.

Put the information transfer online. It is the component that is less important than the assimilation of
this knowledge (but higher educators seem to invest most significantly into this aspect).

So what do we do in lectures and tutorials

Mazur (2013) suggest the following recipe (Figure 1). In the lecture the teacher poses questions and 
explain the details in the question, then give the students a few minutes to consider their answer in
silent individual contemplation. The next step is to poll the students, the 

Poll the students individually. (Do not show the poll results yet)

Get them to convince another student who had a different answer for several minutes.

Poll again. Show the class the re-polling results.

Explain the basis of the answer. If the class is divided, then get different student perspectives.

```{r,teachingflowchart,echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1. A recipe for social learning."}
library(DiagrammeR)
grViz("digraph flowchart {
      # node definitions with substituted label text
      node [fontname = Helvetica, shape = rectangle]        
      tab1 [label = '@@1']
      tab2 [label = '@@2']
      tab3 [label = '@@3']
      tab4 [label = '@@4']
      tab5 [label = '@@5']
      tab6 [label = '@@6']
      
      # edge definitions with the node IDs
      tab1 -> tab2 -> tab3 -> tab4 -> tab5 -> tab6 -> tab1 ;
      }

      [1]: 'question'
      [2]: 'think'
      [3]: 'poll'
      [4]: 'discuss'
      [5]: 'repoll'
      [6]: 'explain'
      ")
```

The wonderful thing about this type of lecture format is that it is:

* Highly active. Students must engage their mind into the discussion.

* Teacher gets immediate feedback; informs teaching practices

* Students assess their own knowledge; get immediate feedback; students can reflect on their own performance

* Time efficient: classroom time is best used for interactive sessions. Peer instruction helps students get
formative feedback which is not dependent on the teaching staff marking assignments.
