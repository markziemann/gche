## Part 1 - Discuss a particular hypothetical candidate

(602 words)

Here is the hypothetical situation we received.

>"Due to a range of personal issues you realise that John is struggling to meet deadlines. He is falling behind his schedule of progress and it is clearly starting to stress him..."

In this part I will identify key resources and readings that supervisors can reference to increase understanding and knowledge of possible candidature issues relevant to this narrative and the policies and procedures for your institutional (Deakin) context.

I will not be discussing in too much detail specifically how the supervisor should manage John's situation as this is outside the scope of the task. 
I will assume that John's candidature has been confirmed and he is in the middle/late phase of his candidature.

Let's start with the institutional policies and procedures. 

Deakin's Higher Degrees by Research (HDR) Policy is the cornerstone reference for supervisors to follow through all phases of a student's candidature (Deakin University 2019a).
The Higher Degrees by Research (HDR) Academic Progress Procedure (Deakin University 2020a) outlines how the progress should be monitored (paragraphs 29-32) and what supervisor should do if they have concerns about student's progress (paragraphs 33-35).
One of the first things that is done for an at risk student is setting up a Progress Support Panel who can work to give the student extra support, advice and refer them to additional resources.
Section 7 of the procedure describes how the Progress Support Panel will be set up.
The Deakin University Regulation 5.3(3) - Assessment and Academic Progress in Higher Degrees by Research policy document (Deakin 2015) also speaks to this.
In particular section 4 addresses unsatisfactory academic progress, whether that is to provide councelling and assistance, or to terminate enrolment.

The Higher Degrees by Research (HDR) Supervision Procedure (Deakin 2019b) is key for supervisors, especially the section on monitoring progress (paragraphs 25-29).
At a higher level, the supervisor should be aware of the _Higher Education Standards Framework (Threshold Standards) 2015_, especially section 4 pertaining to research training, and exceed these minimum standards for supervision and monitoring of HDR student progress.
These are essential because if student feels they have not been properly supervised, the student may complain or take legal action against the university.
To protect against this, supervisors will need to demonstrate that they have been compliant with the level of monitoring, producing evidence to prove it.

With regards to managing challenges like this, there are some tips in the wider literature. 
Denholm and Evans (2007) devote a chapter to managing candidate's health needs, this is useful because John's stress could be considered a mental affliction.
Kearns and Finn (2017) dedicate a chapter to managing common challenges, which drills into the mental health challenges experienced by some candidates and how supervisors can best manage the situation.
James & Baldwin (1999) include a chapter on what to do if academic or personal crises crop up.
From what we know about John, he is experiencing some personal issues and this is beginning to impact his academic performance, so advice from James & Baldwin should be very useful.

Lastly I think HDR supervisors should definitely be trained in mental first aid.
It will help them to identify the warning signs and give them good advice for brining mental health into the discussion in a careful way. 
Deakin has an introduction to mental health first aid unit as part of all staff training. 
This way, we can refer students to get professional mental help support they need. 
CACHE (2020) helped me to understand the different afflictions that are common in todays workplaces, and how as a supervisor I can be more supportive.

## Part 2 - Key policy documents throughout the HDR candidature (400 words)

(489 words)

In the following table I have summarised the major _policy documents and forms_ important to guiding the standards and expectations of HDR supervision during early, mid and late phases of candidature.
Documents necessary from both the candidate and supervisor perspectives are included.
I have focused on documents relevant to the School of Life and Environmental Sciences (LES).

## Part 3 - Where the primary supervisor needs to make judgements (1000 words)

Identify and note the matters on which (you as) the Principal Supervisor need to
act or make a judgement. Develop a schedule that will enable you to monitor the
stages required in candidature for which you are responsible. Produce an
annotated list of the documents and the key judgement(s) required. Where
appropriate, include in the annotations notes and links to the reading that you
have undertaken for the unit. Each document will have its reference point in the
University’s procedures and rules. In some circumstances, the legal status of these
documents and your attention to them will be important should any appeals or
litigation occur (1000 words).

## Part 4 - Key supervisory judgements to support John's candidature progression

For your hypothetical candidate discussed in the collaborative peer cloud
discussions (see 1), explain the key supervisory judgements you will need to make

procedures and resources that you can access to inform the advice you will provide
to the candidate (500 words).
