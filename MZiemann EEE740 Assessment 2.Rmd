## Part A - critical reflection on planning, teaching and supporting learning in terms of core knowledge and professional values

1500 words or equivalent

Part A is asking you to take a critically reflective holistic look at your teaching and approaches to
student learning. In other words, draw on the content on reflective practice e.g. Kolb’s model from weeks 7
and 8 to tell a story in which you critically reflect on your teaching practices and student learning. Details are
below:

* Draw on theories and frameworks of critical reflection to contextualize the reflection with respect to
approaches to and levels of reflection.

* Use e.g. Kolb’s model to frame the reflection in terms of planning, teaching and supporting learning including
current practice, planned changes to current practice and anticipated outcomes.

* Successful engagement across A1 (design, and plan earning activities) and A2 (teach and support learning). Clear concise comprehensive and criticallt compelling evidence of engagement across areas A1 and A2

* Successful engagement in appropriate teaching practices relates to areas of activity (A2) Clear, concise, comrehensive and critically compelling  evidence of successful engagement in appropriate teaching practices related to the areas of activity

* Appropriate knowledge of K1, the subject material, K2 the appropriate learning methods for teaching, learning and assessing in the subject area and at the level of the academic programme and K3, how students learn both generally and within their subject disciplinary areas. USe and value of appropriate learning technologies to support students in achiving learning outcomes. In depth detailed and critical knowledge of K1 K2 and K3. Use and value of learning technologis is clearly and convincingly explained with substantive reference to pedagogical research. There is a clear and convincing explanation of the way in which technologies can supportstudents in achieving learning outcomes

* A commitment to V1, respect individual learners and diverse learning communities and V2 promote participation in Higher Ed and equality of opportunity for learners, and V4 acknowledge the wider context in which higher ed operated recognising the implications for professional practise. Extensive, clear and critically compelling evidence of a commitment to V1, V2 and V4

* Successful incorporation of subject and pedagogic research and/or scholarship within activities, as part of an integrate approach to academic practice. Extensive, clear and critically compelling evidence of the above.

## Part B - Evidence that demonstrates ongoing professional development in planning and teaching

1000 words or equivalent

Assessment 2, Part B is asking you to do something that you have never done before. You need to tell us about
your professional development and provide artefacts – that is evidence e.g. courses that you might have taken
– to evidence your professional development.

Critically analyse ongoing professional development with respect to past experience, current
engagement and future plans. You will also need to provide an appropriate range of evidence and
artefacts that demonstrate ongoing professional development, influence and success in planning and
teaching practice. In doing this you might like to consider the following suggestions:

* Make reference to your past professional development activities whilst drawing
appropriately on the research based content from this unit as a part of your description of
your current professional development. Make reference to how your engagement with this
unit has informed your plans for future professional development.

* Draw on the artefacts that you have produced whilst progressing through this unit as a
foundation for evidencing your current professional development. Contextualize this with
evidence from the past and for the future e.g. a plan for professional development moving
forwards.


Evidence in engaging in continuing professional development in subjects/disciplines and their pedagogy incorporating research, scholarship and the evaluation of professional practices. 

Provides an extensive and varied range of evidence and artefacts that demonstrate a strong and clear commitment to ongoing professional development, influence and success in planning and teaching practise
